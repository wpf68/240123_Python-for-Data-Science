    Slices a 2D list (represented as a list of lists) between the given

    Parameters:
    - family (list): A 2D list that needs to be sliced.
    - start (int): The starting index for the slice.
    - end (int): The ending index for the slice.

    Side Effects:
    - Prints the shape of the input list and the shape after slicing.
